#### Week 1 - Background Scenery ####

Use p5 drawing functions such as rect, ellipse, line, triangle and point to draw the scenery as set out in the code comments. The items should appear next to the text titles.

Each bit of scenery is worth two marks:

0 marks = not a reasonable attempt
1 mark = attempted but it's messy or lacks detail
2 marks = You've used lots of shape functions to create the scenery

I've given titles and chosen some base colours, but feel free to imaginatively modify these and interpret the scenery titles loosely to match your game theme.
